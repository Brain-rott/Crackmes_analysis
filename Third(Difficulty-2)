This Crackme was difficult for me , but it helped me to learn new thing.

Hint:    besided "Password:" if you want to find logic from the reffernce of string you will not get the reffernce. Cause the "Success" and "Wrong" is used by ebp+offset .
         If u want to start from "entry" you will get many system defined code which is not part of your concern.
         for me best approach is dynamically run one by one instruction until u find the logic of printing "Password:"
                                                    or,
         go to the string refference of "Password" and use string refference until u go to the "entry"
         then, find the function which is taking input.
         then analyse the code.
         u will not find direct comparision between required input and given input but the logic is obsficated.
         if u dont want to reverse the code, u can still find it during dynamic analysis.
